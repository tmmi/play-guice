    <h2>
        Play with Dependency Injection using Google Guice
    </h2>

    <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" target="_blank">Dependency injection</a> is a design
        pattern that frees your code from creational concerns, making your code cleaner and easier to test.
    </p>

    <p>
        This tutorial illustrates how easy it is to use a dependency injection framework with Play.
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/" target="_blank">Guice</a> is used here, however other
        dependency injection frameworks such as <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-framework" target="_blank">Spring</a>
        can be supported in a similar manner.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although Scala is used here, Play and Java can also easily use dependency injection frameworks. Check out the
        <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/play-spring-data">Play Spring Data</a> example for a Java example
        of using Spring with Play after this tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
        This tutorial will take about 10 minutes to complete and assumes that you are already familiar with the basics
        of a Play application.
    </p>
</div>

    <h2>
        The Mission
    </h2>

    <p>
        The mission is to use the familiar starting point of a Play application and enhance it with dependency
        injection. We will be taking the
        <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.scala" class="shortcut">Application</a> class and injecting a a
        <a href="#code/app/services/TextGenerator.scala" class="shortcut">TextGenerator</a> instance into it.
        TextGenerator is an abstract class and we have a concrete implementation of it in the form of
        <a href="#code/app/services/TextGenerator.scala" class="shortcut">WelcomeTextGenerator</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        TextGenerator is a rudimentary service that simply generates text. You'll have more useful
        services in your code e.g. a repository service that is backed by a concrete class to communicate with a
        database. By using dependency injection we can configure the type of service required outside of the class that
        needs to call on it.
    </p>

<div>
    <h2>
        @Inject and @Singleton
    </h2>

    <p>
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/Inject.html" target="_blank">@Inject</a> is the
        <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330" target="_blank">JSR-330</a> standard for declaring that an object
        is required to be injected into another object.
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/Singleton.html" target="_blank">@Singleton</a> is
        also part of JSR-330 and declares that a single instance is to be shared across multiple injections.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our shared <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.scala" class="shortcut">Application</a> instance declares
        that it requires an instance of the TextGenerator type. We are using what is known as
        <a href="http://misko.hevery.com/2009/02/19/constructor-injection-vs-setter-injection/">"constructor
            injection"</a> here, the alternate being what is known as "setter injection". We prefer constructor
        injection as once that property is assigned it cannot be changed i.e. the value is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object" target="_blank">immutable and inherently thread safe</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/app/services/TextGenerator.scala" class="shortcut">TextGenerator</a> does not require anything
        special in order to be "injectable" i.e. something that can be injected into something else. We have declared
        <a href="#code/app/services/TextGenerator.scala" class="shortcut">TextGenerator</a> as an abstract class here
        but it can be any type i.e. a concrete class or a trait (we have used an abstract class in recognition of the
        "is-a" relation between vs "has-a").
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/app/services/TextGenerator.scala" class="shortcut">WelcomeTextGenerator</a> is a concrete
        implementation of the TextGenerator. Having the implementation separated from the injectable type frees you to
        provide alternate implementations of it. For this project the application will share a single instance of
        WelcomeTextGenerator; hence the
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/Singleton.html" target="_blank">@Singleton</a>
        annotation. Our tests will use a mocked version of WelcomeTextGenerator so that the classes that are injected
        with a TextGenerator can be easily tested.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that although we use @Singleton on the Application and WelcomeTextGenerator, these
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/Scopes" target="_blank">"scopes"</a> can be overridden when
        it comes to binding. Binding is discussed next.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Binding</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/app/Global.scala" class="shortcut">Global</a> brings the dependency injection system to life
        by establishing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph" target="_blank">dependency graph</a>
        and then providing Play a means of resolving object instances under its management.
    </p>

    <p>
        First of all an
        <a href="http://google-guice.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/inject/Injector.html" target="_blank">Injector</a>
        is created. An Injector is responsible building the dependency graph. Our injector
        states that whenever a type of <code>TextGenerator</code> is required then use an instance of
        <code>WelcomeTextGenerator</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next thing is that <code>getControllerInstance</code> will return object instances from the dependency
        injection system.
    </p>

    <p>
        An interesting point to note is that the <a href="#code/app/Global.scala" class="shortcut">Global</a> object
        is the only place in our application where there is Guice specific code. This is because JSR-330's @Inject and
        @Singleton annotations are being used. You should therefore be able to use this project's main files and other
        dependency injection frameworks with very little modification.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        Routing Concerns
    </h2>

    <p>
        By convention Play looks for an object instance when resolving routes. However
        <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> can be configured so that
        locating the route instance will call upon the <a href="#code/app/Global.scala" class="shortcut">Global</a>
        object's <code>getControllerInstance</code> method. A simple "@" symbol in front of the controller method
        path in the <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> is all that is required
        i.e. <code>@controllers.Application.index</code>.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>
        Testing
    </h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/test/controllers/ApplicationTest.scala" class="shortcut">ApplicationTest</a>
        illustrates a benefit of dependency injection where a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object" target="_blank">mock</a> of the
        <a href="#code/app/services/TextGenerator.scala" class="shortcut">TextGenerator</a> is used for
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank">unit testing</a>
        purposes. Using a mock makes testing easier as we are not interested in testing the actual type implemented
        by the mock - just the calls that we make upon it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="#code/test/controllers/ApplicationIT.scala" class="shortcut">ApplicationIT</a> is an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_test" target="_blank">integration test</a> that brings our
        dependency injection system into life and sets expectations on what should be seen upon invoking the controller.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/test/controllers/ApplicationFT.scala" class="shortcut">ApplicationFT</a>
        is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_test" target="_blank">functional test</a>. Note that the
        entire application is run and the test is around sending HTTP requests and verifying their responses. Just as
        with the integration test, the dependency injection system is tested thoroughly.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Conclusion
    </h2>

    <p>
        This tutorial has introduced how Google Guice can be used for developing Play applications. Other dependency
        injection systems such as Spring can be similarly incorporated. The Global object establishes the dependency
        injection system and the routes file requires classes to be referenced via the '@' symbol.
    </p>

    <p>
        By separating the creational concerns from a class, classes can remain focused on the job they are intended to
        do and have their code remain clean and devoted to that purpose. In addition your classes will become more
        testable, particularly from a unit test perspective, given that injectable types can easily be mocked.
